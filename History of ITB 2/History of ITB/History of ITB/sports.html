	<article><p>The role of ITB Sport is to facilitate any student who wishes to partake in physical activity while they complete their studies in ITB. 

	Our Sports Development Officer, Ronan Keaskin, along with our two sports interns, work with ITB students to provide an excellent sporting environment. 

	Along with providing excellent sporting facilities, there are also active club programmes catered to suit student needs. </p>
	
	<p> One of ITB’s largest clubs is GAA consisting of men’s senior football, fresher’s football, ladies football and men’s hurling. It is also one of ITB's most successful clubs with the Men's Senior football team winning the Trench Cup in 2013, the Men's Hurling team winning their league in 2013 and the Ladies GAA team being crowned Lagan Cup Champions in 2012.</p>
	<p>The soccer club is large with a great following consisting of two men’s teams and a ladies team. The men’s teams were the 2013 CUFL Division 1 winners while the ladies team won the Division 2 regional league beating Trinity College in their final match.</p></article>
